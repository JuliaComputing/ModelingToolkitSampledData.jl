# ModelingToolkitSampledData

[![Build Status](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/ModelingToolkitSampledData.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/ModelingToolkitSampledData.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

A standard library with discrete-time components for ModelingToolkit.

Requires [JuliaSimCompiler.jl](https://help.juliahub.com/juliasimcompiler/stable/).

## Installation
To install this library, first follow the [installation instructions for JuliaSimCompiler](https://juliacomputing.github.io/JuliaSimCompiler.jl/stable/#Installing-and-Using-JuliaSimCompiler). In particular, you need to [add the JuliaHub Registry](https://help.juliahub.com/juliasim/dev/gettingstarted/juliahubregistry/). 

After the registry is added and JuliaSimCompiler is installed, you may install this package. This package is currently not registered in any register and must thus be installed by URL.
